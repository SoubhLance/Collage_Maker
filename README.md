# Collage Maker

# Photo Collage Creator

This Python script uses the Pillow library to create a customizable photo collage from user-selected images. It provides a simple graphical interface using tkinter for image selection. Each image is resized to 500x500 pixels to ensure uniformity and then arranged on a 1500x1500 pixel canvas with a black background. The collage is saved as Photo_Collage.png in the script's directory upon completion. This script is ideal for quickly generating visually appealing collages from a set of images.

# Usage
- Run the script.
- Select up to 5 images using the file dialog that appears.
- The collage will be automatically generated and saved as Photo_Collage.png in the script's directory.

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library (pip install pillow)
