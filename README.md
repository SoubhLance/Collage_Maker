# Collage Maker

## Photo Collage Creator

This Python script uses the Pillow library to create a customizable photo collage from user-selected images. It provides a simple graphical interface using tkinter for image selection. Each image is resized to 500x500 pixels to ensure uniformity and then arranged on a 1500x1500 pixel canvas with a black background. The collage is saved as `Photo_Collage.png` in the script's directory upon completion. This script is ideal for quickly generating visually appealing collages from a set of images.

## Features

- Images are resized to 500x500 pixels for uniformity

## Usage

2. Select up to 5 images using the file dialog that appears.
